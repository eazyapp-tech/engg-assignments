# Task Assignment: Implement Dynamic App Icon Change in Android Application

## Objective

Develop a simple Android application and add functionality to dynamically change the app icon without altering the package name. This feature enhancement aims to provide users with the flexibility to customize the app's appearance without affecting its core functionality.

## Feature Description

Implement the following features in the Android application:

1. **Simple Android Application:** Develop a basic Android application with minimal functionality.
   
2. **Dynamic App Icon Change:** Add the ability for users to dynamically change the app icon without modifying the package name. Users should be able to select from a predefined set of icons or upload their custom icons.

## Task Details

### Application Development

1. **Basic Android Application:** Create a simple Android application with a clean user interface. The application should include at least one main activity.

2. **Icon Selection Interface:** Develop an interface within the application that allows users to select the desired app icon. This interface should provide options for users to:
   - Choose from a predefined set of icons.
   - Upload custom icons from their device.

3. **Dynamic Icon Implementation:** Integrate functionality to dynamically change the app icon based on the user's selection. Ensure that the app icon changes seamlessly without requiring a package name change.

### Code Reference

You can refer to the specific code causing the issue in the following file:

### Documentation

1. **Build Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to build and run the Android application on various devices and emulators. Include any necessary dependencies or configurations.

2. **Usage Guidelines:** Explain to users how they can utilize the dynamic app icon change feature within the application.

### Submission Guidelines

1. **Repository Creation:** Create a new repository on GitHub or GitLab to host your project.

2. **Code Implementation:** Implement the specified features in the Android application codebase.

3. **Repository Submission:** Share the repository link with us for evaluation.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** Ensure that the Android application functions as expected, allowing users to select and apply app icons dynamically.

## Additional Notes

- Feel free to use any third-party libraries or frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the required features.
